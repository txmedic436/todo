# todo
A command line tool for tracking your todo items.
This tool was orginally developed as a project for me to practice with.

BUGS:
4/24/23 - If the .todo.dat file does not exist in the same directory as the todo binary, it will fail. File will need to be manually created (use touch command). Once the file is created it works without issue. I believe the failure is due to permissions and todo may need to be initally ran with super user privaleges.
